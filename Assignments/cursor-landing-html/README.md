Instructions
Recreate a desktop-first developer tool landing page inspired by the Cursor website. The goal of this assignment is visual and structural accuracy, not creativity or interactivity.

Focus on making your page look as close as possible to the original in terms of:

Page structure and section layout

Typography and font usage

Color palette and spacing

Overall visual hierarchy

You are not required to add animations or interactions.
